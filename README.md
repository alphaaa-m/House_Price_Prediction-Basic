## 🧠 Key Insights

1. **Tree-Based Models Excel**  
   - Gradient Boosting and Random Forest provide superior accuracy.  
   - Effective in capturing non-linear relationships.

2. **Linear Models Are Limited**  
   - Useful for baseline comparisons.  
   - ElasticNet stands out with balanced regularization.

3. **Model-Specific Cautions**  
   - Polynomial Regression shows high R² but risks overfitting.  
   - SVR demands proper feature scaling and kernel tuning.
